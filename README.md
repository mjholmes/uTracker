# uTracker - a micro RF tracker for HAB use

This tracker builds on the basic tracker i built about a year ago. It is based on an Arduino 328 and uses a bespoke PCB with surface mount components to achiever a much smaller form factor than the previous basic tracker.

The board makes use of a dc/dc step up converter providing 3.3v from a single AA/AAA battery. Unusually for smaller boards this uses the NTX2 / NTX2b for the RF transmitter.
